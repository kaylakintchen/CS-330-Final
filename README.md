How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I like to thoroughly look at the objectives and create a plan that ensures I complete all of the objectives. With a plan in place, I'm able to then focus my energy on development strategies.

How do I approach developing programs?

I took a modular approach to developing my code, completing one objective at a time. This makes my code easier to read, understand, and modify if necessary. Following the milestones, I worked on my project in week long iterations completing one piece of the development each week. In completing this, I gained a lot of experience in learning to properly organize my code.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Aside from hoping to work in a software engineering position, computer science has taught me a lot about analytical thinking, patience, persistance, and self confidence.
